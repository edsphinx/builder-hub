## üõ°Ô∏è Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, we strongly encourage you to report it responsibly.

**Please DO NOT open a public GitHub issue.**

Instead, please send a detailed report to our private security contact:

**[edsphinx@gmail.com](mailto:edsphinx@gmail.com)** *(Replace with your actual private security email)*

Please include the following in your report:
- A detailed description of the vulnerability.
- The contract(s) and network(s) affected.
- Steps to reproduce the issue.
- Any potential impact you have identified.

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and will work with you to understand and resolve the issue. We plan to offer a bug bounty program in the future to reward researchers for their contributions.

##  implemented Security Measures

The GasX Protocol is built with a security-first mindset. The following measures and best practices are currently in place:

### 1. Smart Contract Security
- **Immutable First:** All V1 paymaster contracts are deployed as **immutable** to provide maximum trust and prevent malicious upgrades.
- **Separation of Concerns:** The protocol is broken into small, single-responsibility contracts (e.g., `GasXWhitelistPaymaster`, `GasXConfig`). This minimizes the attack surface of each component.
- **Use of Audited Libraries:** We rely on the latest, battle-tested libraries from OpenZeppelin for critical operations like `Ownable` and `ECDSA`.
- **Defensive Programming:** Contracts include robust checks for all inputs, such as the "fail-fast" validation logic, gas limit ceilings, and on-chain oracle price deviation checks.
- **Professional Testing:** The project has a comprehensive test suite, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, with high code coverage.

### 2. Operational Security
- **Multi-Chain Configuration:** All network-specific addresses and parameters are managed in a central configuration file and injected at deployment, preventing hardcoding errors.
- **Professional Deployment Workflow:** We use a standardized suite of Hardhat scripts and a `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` to ensure deployments are repeatable and safe.
- **Pre-Flight Checks:** A `check:preflight` script is used to validate the environment and on-chain state before running critical operations on a live network.

##  audits

- **Internal Review:** The codebase has undergone extensive internal peer review.
- **Static Analysis:** We use tools like Slither in our CI/CD pipeline to automatically check for common vulnerabilities.
- **External Audit:** A professional, third-party security audit is planned as a key milestone in our **[Roadmap](./docs/overview/02_roadmap.md)** before any significant mainnet deployment with user funds at scale.
