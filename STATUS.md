# Current Development Status

This document serves as a checkpoint for the ongoing development session, detailing the current state of the project, the problem being addressed, and the next steps.

## Session Summary (July 20, 2025)

### Work Completed

1.  **`GasX.sol` Compatibility Fix:**
    - Investigated and confirmed that the deployed `EntryPoint` is `v0.8.0`.
    - Analyzed the `EntryPoint v0.8.0` source code to understand its `paymasterAndData` structure.
    - Identified an incompatibility in our `GasX.sol` contract where it incorrectly parsed the `paymasterAndData` field, leading to an "expired!" error.
    - Corrected the logic in `GasX.sol` to be fully compatible with `EntryPoint v0.8.0` by properly handling the 52-byte static field structure.

2.  **E2E Local Test Repair (`GasX.e2e.local.test.ts`):**
    - Refactored the entire test to correctly construct a `PackedUserOperation` for `EntryPoint v0.8.0`.
    - Implemented the correct method for pre-calculating the smart account's address (`getSenderAddress`).
    - Correctly packed gas fields (`accountGasLimits`, `gasFees`) into `bytes32`.
    - Fixed the `paymasterAndData` structure to be a 52-byte value.
    - Implemented the correct EIP-712 signing method (`signTypedData`) to resolve the `AA24 signature error`.

3.  **`MockTarget.sol` Correction:**
    - Added a `counter` state variable to the mock contract to allow for successful verification of the `execute` call in the test.

4.  **Documentation:**
    - Added detailed, step-by-step comments to `GasX.e2e.local.test.ts` explaining the `UserOperation` construction flow.
    - Updated `ARCHITECTURE.md` to document the `EntryPoint v0.8.0` compatibility fix.
    - Updated `README.md` to highlight the verified compatibility.

5.  **Git History:**
    - Created separate, atomic commits for each logical change (contracts, tests, documentation) to maintain a clean and understandable project history.

### Current Status

The local end-to-end test suite (`GasX.e2e.local.test.ts`) is now fully functional and passing. The `GasX.sol` contract is compatible with `EntryPoint v0.8.0`. The project is in a stable state with a solid foundation for local testing.

---

## Next Steps

- Proceed with the analysis and repair of the remaining test files, likely starting with the public network E2E tests (`GasX.e2e.public.test.ts`).
- Create a comprehensive `SESSION_SUMMARY.md` for the current session.

## Session Summary (July 13, 2025)

### Work Completed

1. **Deployment Script Refinement:**
   - Corrected `EntryPoint` address usage in deployment scripts (`02_deploy_gasx.ts`).
   - Implemented validation logic in deployment scripts to prevent misconfigurations.
   - Ensured correct environment resolution (`packages/hardhat/helpers/environment.ts`).
2. **Automated Verification:**
   - Implemented automatic contract verification post-deployment for public networks (`packages/hardhat/helpers/verify.ts` integrated into deploy scripts).
3. **Automated Deployment History:**
   - Created `99_generate_history.ts` to automatically generate `deployHistory.md` after deployments.
4. **Documentation & Project Structure:**
   - Created `deployHistory.md` (English version).
   - Created `CONTRIBUTING.md` (English version) detailing development and deployment processes.
   - Created `ARCHITECTURE.md` detailing the project's smart contract architecture.
   - Updated `README.md` to link to new documentation files.
   - Added `KNOWN_ISSUES` section in `FUTURE_FEATURES.md` for `permissionless` integration.
5. **Git History Cleanup:**
   - Organized all changes into atomic, conventionally-formatted Git commits.

### Current Problem: `permissionless` Integration in Hardhat Tests

**Test File:** `packages/hardhat/test/sponsorship.test.ts`
**Error:** `InvalidAddressError: Address "undefined" is invalid.`
**Location:** Occurs within `toSimpleSmartAccount` (from `permissionless`) when trying to encode deploy data.

**Debugging Information Confirmed (via `console.log`):**

- `process.env.DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY_ENCRYPTED` is loaded and has a value.
- `process.env.DEPLOYER_PASSWORD` is loaded and has a value.
- The decryption of the wallet using `ethers.Wallet.fromEncryptedJson` is successful, and `deployerPrivateKey` has a valid value.

**Current Hypothesis:**
The error `InvalidAddressError: Address "undefined" is invalid.` is occurring because `simpleAccountFactoryDeployment.address` is `undefined` when `deployments.get("SimpleAccountFactory")` is called within the test's `before` hook. This happens despite `SimpleAccountFactory` having been successfully deployed to `scrollSepolia` in a previous step.

**Reason for Hypothesis:**
The test is being run with `yarn test:file test/sponsorship.test.ts` which, after modification, now points to `--network scrollSepolia`. However, the `deployments.get()` function within the Hardhat test environment might not be correctly loading the deployment artifacts from the `deployments/scrollSepolia/` directory, or the `SimpleAccountFactory.json` file itself might be missing or malformed in that specific deployment folder.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Verify `SimpleAccountFactory.json` content:** Read the content of `packages/hardhat/deployments/scrollSepolia/SimpleAccountFactory.json` to confirm its existence and that it contains a valid `address` field.
2. **Isolate `deployments.get()`:** If the file exists and is valid, we need to further debug why `deployments.get()` is returning `undefined` in the test context. This might involve adding more `console.log` statements around `deployments.get()` calls.
