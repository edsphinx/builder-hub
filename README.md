# Builder-Hub: The GasX Suite of Paymasters

![Builder-Hub Logo](https://github.com/edsphinx/builder-hub/blob/main/.github/assets/gasx.png)

**GasX is a professional suite of ERC-4337 Paymasters designed to eliminate gas fee friction for any dApp.**
_Sponsor transactions completely with our **Whitelist Paymaster**, or empower users to pay gas with tokens like **USDC** using our **ERC20 Fee Paymaster**. GasX is the flagship protocol of Builder-Hub._

## ✨ Why GasX Matters

On-chain adoption stalls when new users must first acquire a native gas token (like ETH) before they can perform any action. The **GasX Suite** directly solves this by offering two powerful solutions that dApps can integrate:

1.  **Complete Sponsorship (`GasXWhitelistPaymaster`):**
    -   **Problem:** You want to offer a truly free "first mint" or "create profile" experience to onboard new users.
    -   **Solution:** The protocol uses the `GasXWhitelistPaymaster` to pay 100% of the gas fees for specific, pre-approved actions, creating a frictionless, Web2-like experience.

2.  **Convenient Payments (`GasXERC20FeePaymaster`):**
    -   **Problem:** Your users hold stablecoins like USDC but don't have ETH on the right network to pay for gas.
    -   **Solution:** The `GasXERC20FeePaymaster` allows users to pay for their own transactions using USDC. The protocol handles the on-chain price conversion and pays the network in ETH, abstracting away the native gas token entirely.

The GasX Suite is currently deployed and tested on **Arbitrum Sepolia** and **Scroll Sepolia** and is fully compatible with EntryPoint v0.8.

## ✅ Comprehensive Test Coverage

The GasX Protocol is rigorously tested using a multi-layered approach to ensure reliability and security. Our test suite includes unit tests, integration tests, fuzz tests, and invariant tests.

| Test Type | Contract / System Tested | Key Verifications |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Unit & Integration** | `GasXWhitelistPaymaster` | Owner-only access, selector whitelisting, gas limit enforcement, oracle signature logic, pausable, emergency withdrawal. |
| | `GasXERC20FeePaymaster` | Token fee payments, price oracle integration, pausable functionality. |
| | `GasXSubscriptions` | Plan management, credit system, ETH/token payments, CEI pattern. |
| | `GasXConfig` | Correct deployment, access control, and parameter updates. |
| | `MultiOracleAggregator`| Oracle management, average/median price calculation, and deviation checks. |
| **Fuzz Testing** | `GasXWhitelistPaymaster` | 9 fuzz tests with 1,000 runs each. |
| | `GasXSubscriptions` | 9 fuzz tests with 1,000 runs each. |
| **Invariant Testing** | `GasXWhitelistPaymaster` | 9 invariant properties verified via Echidna. |
| | `GasXSubscriptions` | 7 invariant properties verified via Echidna. |
| **End-to-End (E2E)** | Full AA Stack (Local) | Simulates a complete, sponsored `UserOperation` on a local Hardhat network. |
| | Full AA Stack (Public) | Verifies the entire flow on live testnets (e.g., Arbitrum Sepolia) using a real bundler. |

### Coverage Summary

| Contract | Statements | Branches | Functions | Lines |
|----------|------------|----------|-----------|-------|
| `GasXWhitelistPaymaster` | 100% | 88.1% | 100% | 100% |
| `GasXERC20FeePaymaster` | 100% | 96.88% | 100% | 100% |
| `GasXSubscriptions` | 93.18% | 68.82% | 88.57% | 95.57% |
| `GasXConfig` | 100% | 91.67% | 100% | 100% |

## 🛠️ Architectural & Security Highlights

-   **Security-First Design:** V1 contracts are deployed as **immutable** for maximum trust. The protocol uses a strict separation of concerns and includes on-chain protections like gas ceilings and selector whitelists.
-   **Pausable Contracts:** All paymasters can be paused by the owner in case of emergency, using OpenZeppelin's `Pausable` with `whenNotPaused` modifier.
-   **Emergency Recovery:** `emergencyWithdrawEth()` allows recovery of accidentally sent ETH.
-   **Comprehensive Events:** All admin actions emit events for monitoring: `LimitsUpdated`, `SelectorUpdated`, `DevModeChanged`, `Paused`, `Unpaused`, `EmergencyWithdraw`.
-   **Multi-Paymaster Suite:** A suite of specialized paymasters allows dApps to choose the exact tool for their needs.
-   **Resilient On-Chain Oracles:** A robust `MultiOracleAggregator` provides reliable price data with built-in deviation checks.
-   **Chain-Agnostic Architecture:** Professional deployment scripts and a centralized configuration allow for seamless multi-chain support.
-   **Off-Chain Extensibility:** Paymasters support time-bound signatures from off-chain services for powerful, real-time validation logic.
-   **Analytics & Monitoring:** Paymasters emit detailed events like `GasSponsored` on every successful transaction.
