# Builder-Hub: The GasX Suite of Paymasters

![Builder-Hub Logo](https://github.com/edsphinx/builder-hub/blob/main/.github/assets/gasx.png)

**GasX is a professional suite of ERC-4337 Paymasters designed to eliminate gas fee friction for any dApp.**
_Sponsor transactions completely with our **Whitelist Paymaster**, or empower users to pay gas with tokens like **USDC** using our **ERC20 Fee Paymaster**. GasX is the flagship protocol of Builder-Hub._

## ‚ú® Why GasX Matters

On-chain adoption stalls when new users must first acquire a native gas token (like ETH) before they can perform any action. The **GasX Suite** directly solves this by offering two powerful solutions that dApps can integrate:

1.  **Complete Sponsorship (`GasXWhitelistPaymaster`):**
    -   **Problem:** You want to offer a truly free "first mint" or "create profile" experience to onboard new users.
    -   **Solution:** The protocol uses the `GasXWhitelistPaymaster` to pay 100% of the gas fees for specific, pre-approved actions, creating a frictionless, Web2-like experience.

2.  **Convenient Payments (`GasXERC20FeePaymaster`):**
    -   **Problem:** Your users hold stablecoins like USDC but don't have ETH on the right network to pay for gas.
    -   **Solution:** The `GasXERC20FeePaymaster` allows users to pay for their own transactions using USDC. The protocol handles the on-chain price conversion and pays the network in ETH, abstracting away the native gas token entirely.

The GasX Suite is currently deployed and tested on **Arbitrum Sepolia** and **Scroll Sepolia** and is fully compatible with EntryPoint v0.8.

## üìà Project Status & Milestones

The GasX Protocol has achieved a **feature-complete MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** state. The core contracts, tooling, and documentation have been professionally architected, providing a stable foundation for rigorous testnet validation and future expansion.

| Category | Deliverable | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
| **Smart Contracts** | **`GasXWhitelistPaymaster`** deployed and verified on-chain. | ‚úÖ |
| | **`GasXConfig`** and **`MultiOracleAggregator`** deployed and verified. | ‚úÖ |
| | **`GasXERC20FeePaymaster`** development in progress. | ‚è≥ |
| **Tooling** | Professional, multi-chain Hardhat deployment and testing suite. | ‚úÖ |
| **Frontend** | Functional Next.js demo app for gasless transactions. | ‚úÖ |
| **Testing** | Comprehensive unit, integration, and E2E tests with high coverage. | ‚úÖ |
| **Documentation** | Complete `/docs` suite, including architecture, guides, and references. | ‚úÖ |
| **Open Source** | MIT License, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `SECURITY.md` in place. | ‚úÖ |

The project is fully prepared for deployment and E2E testing on the **Arbitrum** network.

## ‚úÖ Comprehensive Test Coverage

The GasX Protocol is rigorously tested using a multi-layered approach to ensure reliability and security. Our test suite, executed via Hardhat, covers everything from individual contract logic to full, end-to-end transaction flows on live testnets.

| Test Type | Contract / System Tested | Key Verifications |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Unit & Integration** | `GasXWhitelistPaymaster` | Owner-only access, selector whitelisting, gas limit enforcement, oracle signature logic. |
| | `GasXConfig` | Correct deployment, access control, and parameter updates. |
| | `MultiOracleAggregator`| Oracle management, average/median price calculation, and deviation checks. |
| **End-to-End (E2E)** | Full AA Stack (Local) | Simulates a complete, sponsored `UserOperation` on a local Hardhat network. |
| | Full AA Stack (Public) | Verifies the entire flow on live testnets (e.g., Arbitrum Sepolia) using a real bundler. |

> The entire test suite is run automatically on every commit via our **Continuous Integration** pipeline.

## üõ†Ô∏è Architectural & Security Highlights

-   **Security-First Design:** V1 contracts are deployed as **immutable** for maximum trust. The protocol uses a strict separation of concerns and includes on-chain protections like gas ceilings and selector whitelists.
-   **Multi-Paymaster Suite:** A suite of specialized paymasters allows dApps to choose the exact tool for their needs.
-   **Resilient On-Chain Oracles:** A robust `MultiOracleAggregator` provides reliable price data with built-in deviation checks.
-   **Chain-Agnostic Architecture:** Professional deployment scripts and a centralized configuration allow for seamless multi-chain support.
-   **Off-Chain Extensibility:** Paymasters support time-bound signatures from off-chain services for powerful, real-time validation logic.
-   **Analytics & Monitoring:** Paymasters emit detailed events like `GasSponsored` on every successful transaction.
